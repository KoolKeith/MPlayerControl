This is a .NET wrapper library for MPlayer.  It has been tested on Windows xP/7 and Ubuntu Linux 10.10 and OpenSuse Linux 10.3.  It should also work on OS X although it has not been tested.

On windows it requires that there be a directory and file "backend\mplayer.exe" in it in the same folder as the dll. On all other system it requires that mplayer be installed and in the path. It may require some tweaks to getting working on some systems.

It can play both audio and video files. It includes a sample user interface.

It currently supports play, pause, stop. seek and some other basic functionality. I only add new features as I require them or people send in patches.
